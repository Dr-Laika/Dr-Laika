Greetings, I’m Dr-Laika but most people know me as Greeny and as Jonah outside of the internet. I just started studying computer science and I am willing grow my skillset quickly. 

Up until now, my projects have not been of major significance. I focused on finding my interests first before diving into anything complexer than a Discord bot.
This shall change with the upload of my latest project.

My main driving force is my own curiosity. And with both old and modern tech being intriguing to me, I am often lead down rabbit-holes which in turn make me stumble upon very specific problems.
Spaceflight and astronomy is also fascinating to me and photography is something I am decent at too.
