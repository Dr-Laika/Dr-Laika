Greetings, I’m Dr-Laika but most people know me as Greeny and as Jonah outside of the internet. I just started studying computer science and I am willing grow my skillset quickly. 

Up until now, my projects have not been of major significance. I focused on finding my interests first before diving into anything complexer than a Discord bot.
This shall change with the upload of my latest project.

I am mainly interested in virtual reality and artificual intelligence but also in spaceflight and astronomy. Photography is something I am decent at too.
