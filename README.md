Greetings, I’m Dr-Laika but most people know me as Greeny and as Jonah outside of the internet. I just started studying computer science and I am willing to grow my skillset quickly. 

Up until now, my projects have not been of major significance. I focused on finding my interests first before diving into anything complexer than a Discord bot.
This shall change now with the upload of my latest project.

My main driving force is my own curiosity. And with both old and modern tech being intriguing to me, I am often led down deep rabbit-holes while exploring new project ideas. Solving complicated occuring problems is part of the realization-process for me and is my method of choice for acquiring new skills.
Spaceflight and astronomy are also fascinating to me and photography is something I am decent at too.
